### 🧭 About Me

I'm a full-stack engineer with 10+ years building secure, elegant, and impactful systems — mostly in fintech and web3. I believe in bold ideas, clean code, and software that makes life better. I lead, mentor, and build scalable solutions from MVPs to production.

Oh, and I love plants 🌿 — more on that soon.
