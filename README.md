### 🧭 About Me

I'm a software engineer with over 10 years of experience building secure 🔐, scalable ⚙️, and thoughtful 💭 systems — mostly in fintech and web3.  
I care about clean architecture 🧼, purposeful design 🎯, and writing code that earns its place. I’m driven by curiosity 🤔, conviction 💪, and the belief that technology can serve people better — when built with care 💚.
Outside of work, you’ll probably find me tending to my plants 🌿, reading about space 🪐, equity ⚖️, or helping someone learn to code 🤝.
